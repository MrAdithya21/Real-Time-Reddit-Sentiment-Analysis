"YouTube was sued for their algorithms recommending terrorist related content in Gonzalez v. Google. YouTube correctly won in the Ninth Circuit because of Section 230. The internet has changed since the 90s but websites have been recommending content to users even at the time Congress crafted 230. Which is why the authors defended YouTube in SCOTUS. 

The 4th Circuit gets it and people can hate Zuck but he correctly won this month in MP v. Meta. Because after all the smoke about algos, people are still trying to sue an ICS for content uploaded to their website by third parties and the clear text in Section 230 says those lawsuits are barred. 

https://casetext.com/case/mp-v-meta-platforms-inc-1

>In 1996, Congress enacted 47 U.S.C. § 230, commonly known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. In Section 230, Congress provided interactive computer services broad immunity from lawsuits seeking to hold those companies liable for publishing information provided by third parties. Plaintiff-Appellant M.P. challenges the breadth of this immunity provision, asserting claims of strict products liability, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress under South Carolina law. In these claims, she seeks to hold Facebook, an interactive computer service, liable for damages allegedly caused by a defective product, namely, Facebook's algorithm that recommends third-party content to users. M.P. contends that Facebook explicitly designed its algorithm to recommend harmful content, a design choice that she alleges led to radicalization and offline violence committed against her father.

>The main issue before us is whether M.P.'s state law tort claims are barred by Section 230. The district court below answered this question ""yes."" We agree. M.P.'s state law tort claims suffer from a fatal flaw; those claims attack the manner in which Facebook's algorithm sorts, arranges, and distributes third-party content. And so the claims are barred by Section 230 because they seek to hold Facebook liable as a publisher of that third-party content. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting Facebook's motion to dismiss.",1740266447.0,StraightedgexLiberal,negative

"I'm pushing 80 so grew up at another time. But people in the USA of my generation learned not to listen to the guy yelling and making unsubstantiated claims. We had local newspaper ownership focused on investigating and reporting on local issues supported by the AP and in some cases their own reporters for national news, 3 national tv news networks each of which were reporting facts because if they didn't the other 2 networks would make the topic of the following day how XYZ's reporting couldn't be trusted. And politics is always, well politics, but we had enough statesmen ('cause they were all men, not to infer that was a good thing) to beat back most non-democratic proposals. There were fringe groups... Amer Communist Party, John Birch Society, Symbionese Liberation Army, etc... but they were frankly thought of as cults rather than as holders of serious political thinking. There were checks and balances.

  
Today anyone with a phone can spew out their particular opinion on whatever, no explanation or understanding of the facts required. And every person with an active social media presence is opening themselves to be manipulated... and we know that the USA's enemies (Russia, Iran, N Korea, China, etc), friends (Israel, Britain, Germany, S Korea, etc) and frankly the USA itself have entire organizations dedicated to constantly spewing out 'information/disinformation' for their own purposes. GIGO...garbage in, garbage out. Lowest common denominator who yells loudest gets heard... and, unfortunately, believed and repeated... the most.

"The deeper issue is using money, which is an entirely made up concept, to determine reality and what is value. 

Capitalism is the ultimate form of this false reality made into ”economic policy” which is based solely on greed and who can collect the most bananas.

“He who has the most bananas wins” is not a sound way to manage the lives of 8billion humans because it always leads to corruption because those with the least morals and feeling of social responsibility will rise to positions of power to solely benefit themselves because that is how capitalism works. 

Because it requires unending growth in a finite system, its end point is predetermined that it will ultimately consume itself and all of the rest of us with it because it can never be sustainable because it MUST GROW and the growth has to come from somewhere. 

Capitalism requires that the majority lose so that the few can benefit and we see this play out every single time because it is a form of social Darwinism. 

Capitalism gave us Elon Musk who believes his wealth is a sign from a universal power that he is the special monkey who knows how it all works and we should all listen to him or else…but ultimately he is not a “special monkey” he is just the monkey with the least amount of empathy and feeling of social responsibility which is why he can make brutal life altering decisions for thousands and now millions of people that will ultimately benefit no one but himself and his small circle….and feel nothing about the lies he tells and suffering he leaves behind because so long as the little line goes up he’s done “the right thing” 

And to your sarcastic comment about “nothing bad happened before” that’s not how history works, capitalism isn’t some “new concept” pulled from thin air, it’s based on what came before and is merely an evolution of monarchy and feudalism which is why it is breaking democracy because the two concepts are not compatible and we choose to pretend they are.",1740265036.0,skillywilly56,negative
